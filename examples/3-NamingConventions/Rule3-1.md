# Rule 3.1 - Classes follow _PascalCase_, also known as _UpperCamelCase_
### Example
```java
package com.revaturelabs;

// OK - uses PascalCase properly
public class CurriculumFactory {}
```

---
### Counter Example - Not _PascalCase_
```java
package com.revaturelabs;

// Not OK - uses Upper Snake Case
public class Curriculum_Factory {}
```

```java
package com.revaturelabs;

// Not OK - uses lowerCamelCase
public class curriculumFactory {}
```
